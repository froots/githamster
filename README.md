# Git Hamster

Because who concentrates when typing git commands?

Depending on an unknown future, this project will either become:

1. An empty-headed single serving site
2. A twitter bot that responds to people tweeting about the common `git checkout hamster` mis-type.
3. A full git wrapper to output hamsters to your terminal to make you feel all warm when using git.
4. A git-based cryptocurrency using real hamsters to generate the energy required for mining.

At the moment only 1) is supported.
